# hello_world
My first repository

Hi, I'm John, 24, new to programming. Interested in web development. 

Installed VS Code has my IDE about 1 month ago, and installed some extensions like liveserver to get going with HTML, CSS and started to learn about styling and frameworks like bootstrap.

I wanted to add some functionality so I dwelved into Vanilla Javascript (and later into DOM, JSON, ES6). Since then, I found Javascript libraries like React, and frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby.js, some back-end javascript with Node.js (including NPM) and Express, and some databases (MongoDB). 

Added some features like Chrome Dev tools (alongside React Dev tools extension for Chrome), some new VS Code extensions, like prettier, reacts snippets, tried to learn typescript, etc... Still pretty new to programming and trying to learn and tackle one of these languages/libraries/frameworks at a time.

Currently interested to tackle on React library alongside some new React features like context API and Hooks.

Any help would be great. Have a nice day!
